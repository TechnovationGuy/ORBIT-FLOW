🚀 OrbitFlow

OrbitFlow is a satellite traffic simulation game built with Python’s turtle module. You’re the mission commander, managing satellites in Earth’s orbit and making sure they don’t go full Michael Bay on each other.

Created for Stanford’s Code in Place 2025, this project turns orbital mechanics into an interactive experience — one where thinking ahead is just as important as reacting fast.

🌌 The Challenge

Pick your difficulty:

🟢 Easy — 3 satellites

🟡 Medium — 5 satellites

🔴 Hard — 7 satellites

Control each satellite using **WASD keys and SPACEBAR to change between Satellites, avoid collisions, and keep Earth’s orbit organized. It’s basically space traffic control, but with colorful visuals and chaotic energy.

🎮 Features

Real-time satellite movement and control

WASD keyboard inputs

Collision detection and game-ending logic

A difficulty selection menu

Optional "Earth" visuals for aesthetics

Polished UI and feedback text

Clean, human-style comments throughout the code

There’s no timer, no score — just a record of how long you survive before space gets spicy.

👨‍🚀 About the Creator

I’m Technovation Guy —Making things work...

This project blends aerospace curiosity, Python logic, and a bit of humor to simulate a serious challenge the space industry faces: managing crowded orbits and preventing satellite collisions.

More than a game, this is an experiment in simulation, control, and creativity under pressure. From writing the code to recording the gameplay to editing the video — every part was handcrafted with passion, precision, and pixels.

OrbitFlow is open-source, fun to tweak, and ready to inspire.Now go play — and whatever you do…

DON’T CRASH THAT SATELLITE. 🚁
